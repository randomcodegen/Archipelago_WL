# Wario Land 1

## Where is the settings page?

You can read through all the settings and generate a YAML [here](../player-settings).

## Important things to note

- Exiting Sherbet Land will put you back onto the Sherbet Land world spot.\
This is a side effect of the locked worlds code. Simply move left and then down to get to Mt. Teapot.

- The Jet powerup will let you dash without having the dash item.\
This is not the case for the Bull powerup.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The game starts with all worlds available (unless World Unlocks is activated).
The following unlock-items can be found in the multiworld:

Abilities:
