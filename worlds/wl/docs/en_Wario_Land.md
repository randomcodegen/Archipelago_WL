# Wario Land 1

## Where is the settings page?

You can read through all the settings and generate a YAML [here](../player-settings).

## Important things to note

- Exiting Sherbet Land will put you back onto the Sherbet Land world spot.\
This is a side effect of the locked worlds code. Simply move left and then down to get to Mt. Teapot.

- The Jet powerup will let you dash without having the dash item.\
This is not the case for the Bull powerup.

- The lake in Parsley Woods 31 gets drained when Parsley Woods 32 is beaten.\
Some logical access might required the lake to still be there.\
In this case simply switch to a different savefile to grab the check.\
The same applies to Mt Teapot 13, which overwrites Mt Teapot 10 (and is unlocked by beating Mt. Teapot 12).

- Turning off autoscrollers messes with stage graphics and can lead to the cart stopping if it goes off screen.\
Use at your own risk.

- Overworld and Subworld movement will be activated once a connection to an Archipelago Server has been established.
